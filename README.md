# Hash-Table
CS261 Data Structures final project

# Purpose
This is a portfolio project for CS 261 - Data Structures. The purpose was to implement a hash table data structure using given hash functions.
A dynamic array developed from an earlier class project was used to store store the hash table. A singly linked list, also developed from an earlier class project was used to implement chaining for collision resolution. Linked list nodes contain key/value pairs as shown in the diagram below.
